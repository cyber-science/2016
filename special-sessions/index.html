<td valign="top" width="717">There is a growing interest worldwide in the ‘cyberspace’ research and in the design and development of cyber- physical systems. Cyberspace is the virtual space realized through the information and communication technologies. Cyber-physical systems are the intersection of cyber systems and physical systems necessitating high and effective coordination and intercommunication between the physical and non-physical components in the cyberspace. Given the complexity and various other challenges involved in the design and development of multidisciplinary cyber-physical systems, it is worthwhile to have a special session focused on applications of cybernetics and systems thinking to the cyber-physical systems.The aim of the special session is to organize enriched and meaningful discussions on the applications of cybernetics and systems thinking to the cyber-physical systems, and particularly ‘human in the loop cyber physical system’ (HiLCPS) that boosts human interactions with the physical world in a positive manner.We invite original and unpublished theoretical and practice-oriented papers focused on applications of cybernetics (including what Heinz von Foerster termed the ‘cybernetics of the observed system’ and the ‘cybernetics of the observing system’; and Norbert Wiener’s assertion that ‘the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal’ is cybernetics) and systems thinking to systems in general and cyber- physical systems, in particular. The papers should be on, but not limited to the following main topics-
<ul><li>Cybernetics for cyber-physical systems</li>
<li>Cybernetics for ‘human in the loop cyber physical system’ (HiLCPS)</li>
<li>Cyber-physical systems through the Systems thinking lens</li>
<li>Case studies on cyber-physical systems for any industry domains</li>

<td valign="top" width="717">With the advancement of Internet, sensor network technologies, the sheer volume of data in network logs are expanding at an increasing speed. Analysing network log data are useful as it enables one to monitor network performance, check compliance with regulation and security policies, and carry out forensic tasks. Recently, there has been an increasing demand for big-data techniques of log analysis to provide predictive analytics. This has brought serious concerns regarding security and privacy risks. By revealing private information, network users may unintentionally reveal their identities and expose their cyber-activities, putting themselves under severe security risks. In this context, traditional methods are no longer sufficient to protect user’s sensitive information and ensure safe transactions. Therefore, it is imperative to reconsider the specification, design and implementation for algorithms and protocols, in order to achieve security, trust, and privacy.The purpose of this special session for CyberSciTech 2016 is two-fold: Firstly, the special session offers a forum for scientists and engineers to exchange ideas on novel analytical techniques using network log data. Secondly, the special session has a thematic focus on emerging technology for security and privacy in the cyberspace. We seek publications on all theoretical and practical work in areas related to the theme above, including (but not limited to) the following areas:
<ol><li>Complex network monitoring</li>
<li>Predictive models and analytics</li>
<li>Cryptographic protocols</li>
<li>Network anonymity (e.g. k-anonymity, differential privacy)</li>
<li>Monitoring and surveillance on social networks</li>
<li>Social login and authentication</li>
<li>Smart grid, wireless sensor networks and Internet of things</li>

This data flood has outperformed our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Rapid expansion of Internet data accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of social networking applications allows users to create contents freely and enlarge the already huge Web volume. Moreover, mobile phones are becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data on people. Trillions of connected components including people and devices will generate a huge data ocean. A new methodology is required for transforming Big Data stored in heterogeneous and different in nature data sources (e.g., legacy systems, Scientific data, sensor and stream databases, Web and Social networks) in to a structured and well interpretable format for target data analytics. This session aims to bring together people from both academia and industry to discuss on big-data issues, case studies, tools and platforms and exchange ideas and thoughts in order to develop core generic technologies, tools and algorithms for wider applications in government and to society.We are seeking papers in, but not limited to, the following main areas:<br>

The session will exchange views on the issues of CPS for sustainable industrialization and innovation, Water sustainability, renewable energy, and energy-efficient industrial environments and processes, and how CPS can help boost the transition to an environmentally-friendly economy.<br>
Due to the huge advancement in science and technology, especially in communications and computing, the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offers valuable tools and solutions to address many challenges of achieving national and international sustainable development such as environmental protections, resources efficiency, and climate changes. CPS will continue to enable our society for achieving the sustainable development due to the integration of sensing, computation, control and networking infrastructures.<br>
This Session will exchange views on issues of strategic importance in the related areas of CPS applied to sustainability which include the dimension of environment protection, social inclusion, and economic growth. The session will also brainstorm ideas and the advancements in the areas of capability, adaptability, scalability, resilience, safety and usability of CPS for sustainable and resilient national critical infrastructures include telecommunications, transports, power, water and food, etc. The session may also provide guidance on CPS procurement, detailing good principles to be applied when procuring goods, products and services for CPS infrastructure for sustainability. The session may also investigate the overall sustainability of lifestyle choices; many companies may have responded by providing consumers with information on the eco-impact of the products they buy and use.<br>
The Special Session on Cyber-Physical Systems for Sustainability (CPS4S) would be initiated as a forum for scientists, engineers, standardization professionals, policy makers, researchers, practitioners, and students to present their latest research results, visions, ideas, and developments in the standardizations of CPS and relevant technologies that can support sustainability. Researchers and professionals are encouraged to submit original research and standardization relevant contributions in all major areas, which include, but not limited to:<br>
– Cyber-physical system for sustainable industrialization and innovation<br>
– Cyber-physical system for human settlement<br>
– Cyber-Physical Systems for Smart Homes<br>
– Cyber-physical system for Water sustainability<br>
– Cyber-physical system for renewable energy<br>
– Cyber-physical system for Institutional capacity on climate change adaptation and mitigation<br>
– Cyber-physical system for sustainable mobility, transport, and logistics<br>
– Cyber-physical system for efficient smart homes, buildings and cities<br>
– Cyber-physical system for energy efficient industrial environments and processes<br>
